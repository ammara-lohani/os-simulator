🖥️ Operating System Simulator Project
📌 Project Overview

This project is an Operating System Simulator designed to demonstrate core OS concepts through a menu-driven interface.
It helps students understand how an operating system manages processes, memory, input/output devices, and other essential system operations.

⚙️ Features / Modules
1️⃣ Process Management

This module simulates how an operating system handles processes.

Process creation and termination

Process scheduling (e.g., FCFS, SJF, Round Robin – if implemented)

Process states (Ready, Running, Waiting)

CPU allocation logic

2️⃣ Memory Management

This module focuses on memory allocation techniques used by operating systems.

Memory allocation and deallocation

Partitioning techniques

Paging / segmentation (if applicable)

Avoids memory wastage and manages free space efficiently

3️⃣ I/O Operations

This module simulates interaction between the OS and input/output devices.

Input and output handling

Device request simulation

Buffering and data transfer concepts

Basic I/O scheduling behavior

4️⃣ Other Operations

This section includes additional operating system functionalities such as:

File handling operations

System information display

User command execution (basic)

Error handling and system messages

🧠 Learning Objectives

Understand core Operating System concepts

Learn how OS components interact with each other

Implement theoretical concepts into a practical simulation

Improve problem-solving and logical thinking skills

🛠️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: (Java / C / C++ / Python — update as per your project)

IDE: (VS Code / IntelliJ / Eclipse / etc.)

Platform: Console-based Application
